# Locks

Locks implements locking mechanisms that have traditionally been used for
protecting shared memory between multiple threads. JavaScript is inherently
single threaded and does not suffer from these security and stability issues.
However, because of its asynchronous eventy nature can still benefit from
making particular operations wait for the completion of others.
